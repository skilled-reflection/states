## aim for the point
and nothing else.

points
are made with two aspects,
a similarity and difference.

a point is sharpest when 
it is self-evident and essential.
the point is made such when
cast in direct contrast with a property it inherently shares with something that is exactly not the point.

dots uniquely placed share a canvas of attn.
 
## the ground

the background to all points is
the persistent, coherent, felt world.

just how all dots share the geometric property of identity surrounded by absence,
all points are "life",
defined in terms of the persistent world.

where life is a journey,
you should go walk it.

if words have any point,
they should take you farther or closer,
faster.
they succeed by assuming the ground under you persists and sticking to the sharp point.

this is true when talking for yourself,
but the point and the ground are different for two people talking. 

## the problem of a shared point

a self-evident cost of communicating
is that the ground and direction must be felt the same for the same point to be seen by both
when it is made.

to do this, either 
- one must imagine the view from the other's position, perspective-taking,
- or both must imagine the overlapping truth, the part of the point that is despite the difference, an "essential" or ideal point
appearing as a persistent point, "meaning." 

the cost of meaning-making is not justified unless meanings can be re-used.
a sentence of meanings is like traveling from point to point, where distance and perspective slowly disappears.
the more you travel, the more words lose their particular meaning to you.

at best a word is a helpful simulation of the world.
commonly and at worst it is a simulation of nothing that will have bearing on your world (nothing that had bearing is relevant until it has future relevance again.)

the persistent quality of a point is the attentional desensitization of difference between two grounds.


(though there are two grounds, 
one for each messenger, neither are ever the point.)
